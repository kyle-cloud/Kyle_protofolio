**[1. Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/kylecloud/titanic-top4percent)**

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

- Built and trained an ensembled model using PyTorch for image classification to recognize cassava leaf disease.
- Ensembled EfficientNet-B3\EfficientNet-B4\ResNeXt models and achieved Top11%.
- Tools: Python, Pandas, PyTorch

**[2. Cassava Leaf Disease Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/kylecloud/cassava-leaf-disease-top11percent)**

As the second-largest provider of carbohydrates in Africa, cassava is a key food security crop grown by smallholder farmers because it can withstand harsh conditions. At least 80% of household farms in Sub-Saharan Africa grow this starchy root, but viral diseases are major sources of poor yields. With the help of data science, it may be possible to identify common diseases so they can be treated. Your task is to classify each cassava image into four disease categories or a fifth category indicating a healthy leaf. With your help, farmers may be able to quickly identify diseased plants, potentially saving their crops before they inflict irreparable damage.

- Analysed and preprocessed data and built models to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
- Trained and compared different models with respective process of feature engineering and achieved Top 4%.
- Tools: Python, Scikit_learn, Xgboost
        
# courses in ML/DS
**[1. Machine Learning - Andrew NG, Coursera](https://github.com/kyle-cloud/ML_coursera)**

It is one of the greatest online course modules introducing machine learning concepts and techniques. By the end of the course, we would have understood how to apply the most advanced machine learning algorithms to such problems as anti-spam, image recognition, clustering, building recommender systems, and many other problems. we'll also know how to select the right algorithm for the right job, as well as become expert at ‘debugging’ and figuring out how to improve a learning algorithm's performance.

This course focused on the Deep Learning with its popular concepts, structures and techniques. Except the basic and detailed explanations about DL in the module, there were adequate experienments for students to carry on with PyTorch. We were expected to process and model the real-world datasets given by the course by hand.

- Obtained a thorough understanding about the course content and got familiar with all the popular techniques and structures in deep learning.
- impplemented all the experienments independantly and completely.
- Tools: Python, PyTorch

# software development

**[1. Localization System based on Mobile Big Data, BJTU](https://github.com/kyle-cloud/findYOU)**

With the rapid development of wireless communication technology, hundreds of millions of mobile data are generated every day in our daily life, and the mobile behavior of objects is diverse while still maintaining regularity. Therefore, this subject switches the big data information according to the base station provided by the mobile base station, excavates its path of action, identifies the petitioner according to it, and provides the petitioner with Real time location information. At the same time, in order to solve the problem of big data storage calculation and track similarity matching, the high-level and low-level models are used. The low-level model combines the segmentation and dimensionality reduction based on MDL (minimum description length) principle with the neighbor grower algorithm (DBSCAN) based on segment clustering to preprocess the track to reduce the system operation time. The high level model combines the two-level planning based on track feature extraction The improved Hausdorff distance based on information entropy, time interpolation and time constraint is combined to match the trajectory to improve the performance of similarity recognition, so as to build a big data processing environment, and finally form a web software that presents the petitioner's trajectory and similar trajectory on the map, and judges the identity information accordingly.

- Used dimensionality reduction, matching and clustering algorithms to help recognize the owner of trajectory efficiently.
- Created or optimized a set of algorithms to improve the performance of clustering and matching.
- Tools: Java, MongoDB, JavaScript

**[2. weChat - online chat platform, BJTU](https://github.com/kyle-cloud/weChat---)**

Instant online communication is becoming more and more popular and necessary. However, SMS, email and other channels are far from meeting the needs of the public for fast and simple communication. Our product, weChat, meets this condition. The mobile phone has replaced the function of SMS, and replaced the email in the aspect of instant communication, which truly meets the user's point-to-point communication needs. The system is a stand-alone software system and web application.

- Wrote all the development documents required, such as feasibility analysis, software requirements specifications.
- Designed prototype and elegant UI,  implemented the function of chatting with single-person and multi-person, and carried out high concurrency experiments.
- Tools: Java, MySQL, JavaScript

**[3. Fingerprint - cyber security, BJTU](https://github.com/kyle-cloud/fingerprint)**

The black industry chain is rising rapidly. Lawbreakers can cheat and avoid tracking through a series of means, such as tampering with IP. In this context, the device fingerprint identification came into being. Device fingerprint refers to the unique identification that can uniquely identify the device, which can not be set by fraudsters. The device fingerprint can be used to identify the device. At present, the fingerprint of the device has been obtained and in-depth research mainly focuses on the software level, such as the browser fingerprint, but the hardware level device fingerprint acquisition research is not enough. This work is based on the existing device fingerprint acquisition technology to improve, in order to achieve the goal of not infringing the user's privacy, achieve a good balance between security and user experience and ensure stability, compatibility and performance under the premise of catering to technology development. The project combines the new API features provided by HTML5 with Windows system management instrumentation in order to obtain the hardware information of local and remote computers and extract the device fingerprint of the device which belongs to the research of device fingerprint at the hardware level.

- Compared Python, Java, C++, C# programming languages in terms of the feasibility of remote acquisition of device information.
